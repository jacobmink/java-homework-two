# Binary Trees and Testing

For tonight's homework, create a Maven project with jUnit in the dependencies (this should be automatic if you use the archetype from the lesson).

In the main folder, next to App.java, create  a Node class and BinaryTree class. The Node should have left, right, and data properties. The BinaryTree should simply have a root property  pointing to the root node. 

In the Binary Tree class, implement the method for inserting new Nodes in the tree.

Then, write tests in the test folder that test the functionality of Nodes and BinaryTrees, ensuring the inserted Nodes end up in the correct spot in the tree.
